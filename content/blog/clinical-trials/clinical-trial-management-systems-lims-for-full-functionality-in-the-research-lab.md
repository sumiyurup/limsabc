It is so much better for the research organization to have a clinical trials facility that runs smoothly, without any major issues at all. Unfortunately, this is just a pipedream however; the right clinical trial management systems LIMS can get the facility pretty darn close. Most research and clinical trials labs have a multitude of different tools to handle the day to day and month to month tasks. This makes no sense. A streamlined clinical trial management systems LIMS that can handle all aspects of managing the research facility would prove to make it much more efficient and essentially, profitable. LIMSABC offers Clinical Trial Management Systems that have full functionality to research labs globally.

 

# **Accurately Managing Specimens with Clinical Trial Management Systems**

The ability to completely manage all of the specimens in the research facility is absolutely essential. Think about the number of times that one employee was searching for a specimen that was being handled by another. This not only causes down time for the employee, but loss of revenue for the facility as a whole. The right clinical trial management systems LIMS can allow users, and administrator to monitor who had or has custody of a specimen and for what purpose. This reduces down time and increases efficiency. The Clinical Trial Management Systems LIMS from LIMSABC allows users to monitor every movement of and test performed on each specimen.

# **Equipment Management with Clinical Trial Management LIMS**

There are so many things to deal with when it comes to managing the equipment within a clinical trials or research facility. Keeping refrigerated or frozen specimens at the correct temperature is essential and must be checked several times daily. Equipment calibrations and maintenance are required to be monitored and recorded as well. This is especially true if there is government funding involved in the clinical trial study. For most research facilities, losing funding could put an end to the important research being done. LIMSABC’s Clinical Trial Management Systems LIMS can handle all aspects of equipment management in the research facility.
