Reproductive Bio Banks are certainly becoming more and more utilized throughout the United States and the world, for that matter. It seems that a lot of people are waiting to have children later in life these days, which makes it more difficult to conceive a child. Many people opt to have their eggs or semen frozen to lower the chances of having children with age-related issues such as Down’s syndrome. Others choose to cryopreserve gametes, in the event they wish to have a full sibling of a previously cryopreserved and implanted gamete. Regardless of the reason, it is the responsibility of the reproductive Bio Bank to ensure the safety, cryopreservation and integrity of the reproductive tissues. At LIMSABC, the LIMS developers are dedicated to offering only the most comprehensive Bio Banking solutions for reproductive cryopreservation facilities.

 

# **Managing Reproductive Tissue with LIMS for Bio Banking**

Trying to manage cryopreserved reproductive tissue without the best LIMS on the market could prove to be devastating for potential parents, as well as the facility and its employees. For this reason, maintaining and accurate and consistent chain of custody is essential. Any movement or transfer of the reproductive tissue must be documented accurately for viable records. This is much easier and effective when the users have access to a LIMS designed specifically for the reproductive Bio Banking industry. The reproductive Bio Banking LIMS offered by LIMSABC will help to ensure that the chain of command for the cryopreserved reproductive tissue in your facility is accurate.

# **User Friendly Reproductive Bio Banking LIMS**

One of the biggest problems faced by reproductive Bio Banks is that the LIMS they are trying to implement are too complicated and frustrating for the employees to utilize easily. Oftentimes, the employees simply avoid trying to figure out how to use it. A Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for Bio Banking solutions shouldn’t be a hassle to implement, or for the employees to effectively use either. A LIMS is supposed to make the management of cryopreserved reproductive tissues and equipment easier for the users. At LIMSABC, we strive to create our reproductive Bio Banking LIMS to be user friendly.
