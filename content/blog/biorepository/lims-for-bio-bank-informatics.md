In the beginning of the 21st Century, researchers finally developed the ability to understand data regarding human risk factors with other lifestyle and demographic data by way of new technologies. The ability now exists for researchers to merge a myriad of molecular genetic information with national, state and county health departments, as well as other epidemiology and clinical data Bio Banks all over the world. The ability to maintain accurate Bio Bank informatics plays a crucial role in handling samples and data in an appropriate amount of time. A Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) specifically designed for Bio Bank informatics can help to aid in the proper management of data. LIMSABC’s LIMS for the Bio Banking field will prove to be a major asset for managing your Bio Bank’s informatics.

 

# **LIMS: A Powerful Asset in the Bio Banking Field**

The need for shared, universal information in the Bio Banking field is great. It helps to have a complete picture regarding lifestyle, medical and genetic information from a variety of sources to aid in locating the origins of specific diseases. The infrastructure of the Bio Bank’s database is an absolutely crucial component in the area of life science research. The genotype data must be accurately loaded, managed, accessed, analyzed, queried and shared with other Bio Banks. There is a great need for novel methods and systems that provide a better ability to gather and store the genotype and phenotype data required. LIMSABC’s LIMS for Bio Banking solutions will fill the current void in this area.

# **Organizing the Bio Bank with a LIMS**

Every Bio Bank needs to be able to be organized, especially when it comes to disease related data for investigating the individual properties of organisms as a whole, as well as both the molecular and cellular properties of the sample tissues.  The documentation of lifestyle surveys along with the biological samples and medical registries help to identify links between a person’s genetic disposition and specific diseases. Maintaining this documentation can easily be accomplished with a LIMS that is specifically designed for Bio Banking solutions. LIMSABC is the premiere provider of Bio Banking LIMS throughout North America, and is also available worldwide.
