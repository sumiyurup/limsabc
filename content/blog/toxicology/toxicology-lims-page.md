There are so many different branches and fields of study or practice in the medical and scientific industry that a “one size fits all” LIS simply isn’t good enough. Running a drug screening lab requires both administration and employees to perform and document a whole host of tasks that the typical, generic Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) simply cannot handle. For this reason, it is essential that toxicology labs invest in a fully functional drug screening LIMS. The right cloud LIS software can make the entire lab run much more smoothly. LIMSABC’s innovative toxicology LIS will do just that!

# Toxicology LIS for Efficient Drug Screening Labs

Toxicology labs must maintain accurate information however; this can be a major problem for them if they are using a generic cloud LIMS. Let’s face it! Without the ability to clear and accurate data records, the drug screening lab simply is as efficient as it could be. If you talk where the rubber meets the road, a highly efficient toxicology lab is significantly more profitable than others lacking in the efficiency department. In all honesty, when a drug screening lad is efficient, the employees are much happier in their work and become even more productive. A pleasant and comfortable workplace for employees will surely boost profits hence; a state of the art toxicology LIS will improve your lab’s bottom line. LIMSABC is the premiere provider of cloud LIS software for toxicology labs worldwide.
