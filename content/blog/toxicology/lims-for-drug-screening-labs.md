Drug screening laboratories have a huge responsibility and the findings that they provide must be of the utmost quality. Without data that has integrity, people can die and people could go to jail. Data quality is an imperative aspect of running a high quality drug screening lab. The old Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) that were developed in the past decade are simply out of date and not the best option for toxicology labs that are trying to grow and produce higher quality data. More reliable results actually make more companies want to do business with that particular drug screening facility. The cloud LIMS software available today is able to help lab employees and organization administers get their jobs done much more easily and with accurate results. LIMS ABC is the number one provider of cloud LIMS for drug screening labs seeking to improve the quality of their data.
