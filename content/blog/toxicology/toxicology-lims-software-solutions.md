Toxicology LIS software is advantageous to busy lab facilities. Though overwhelmed lab technicians are aware that the work they do offers answers and diagnoses for patients; busy toxicology labs may have a difficult time analyzing the samples received on a daily basis. Careful analysis requires time that busy doctors and patients are not necessarily willing to wait for however; when recording results for life threatening illness and disease, or simple mandatory drug testing for employment, are dependent upon extremely careful recording. Time is critical in a lab environment. Cloud LIS software is one way to minimize time spent recording information so that more time can be spent analyzing cultures. A fully functional LIS system simplifies the recording process allowing the lab technician to use a few simple keystrokes verses page after page of data entry. This also allows physicians and medical facilities the ability to access the information more quickly and patient anxiety will be put to rest more easily. LIMSABC is the premiere provider of toxicology LIS software worldwide.
