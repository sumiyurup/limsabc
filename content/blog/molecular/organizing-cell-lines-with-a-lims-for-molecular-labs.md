The molecular laboratory industry has been growing in leaps and bounds over the past very decades. Much of this is due to the increase of people seeking more personalized medical attention. Of course, the need for researching cell lines and their relationship to syndromes, diseases and cancers also causes the need for molecular lab facilities to grow quickly. With more and more labs out there, there is also a great increase of the regulations and guidelines they need to follow. Having a high quality Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) can make all of the tasks in the molecular lab much easier. LIMSABC offers a powerful LIMS for molecular labs.

 

# **LIMS for Linking Cell Lines**

The ability to link cell lines directly to all experiments performed is an important asset for the molecular lab. By being able to navigate quickly between a variety of experiments performed within the cell lines, the research data is much more easily accessed by the user. The right LIMS for molecular laboratory facilities will surely prove to be beneficial for both the company and the users. With a molecular lab LIMS from LIMSABC, the users will have instant access to experiments past and present done within a specific cell line.

# **Monitoring Samples with Molecular Lab LIMS**

A molecular lab LIMS provides the users with the ease of monitoring samples on their mobile devices, as well as on the lab’s computers. LIMS can allow the user to access the data determining how other samples within the facility are related to a particular cell line. They can also access information about the original sample, such as human tissue, or even rodent tissue. Naturally, the users will also have the ability to monitor data regarding derived products, such as immunoprecipitation or lysates. Protocols can also be directly connected to relevant cell lines to ensure guidelines are followed precisely. This is a huge help when dealing with stem cells and neurons, which can be quite difficult to culture. LIMSABC’s Molecular lab LIMS will help to streamline the processes and data pertaining to cell lines.

# **LIMSABC: State of the Art LIMS**
