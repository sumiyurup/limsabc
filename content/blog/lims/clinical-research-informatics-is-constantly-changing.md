Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) has been quickly evolving over the past few years and continues to do so now. The focus on developing innovative informatics solutions, theories and tools has drastically increased. The increase in Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) is mainly due to the need for integrating data for distribution to several facilities. LIMS ABC understands the intricate needs of clinical research facilities. Their dedication to Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) is second to none in the industry. This is why they are pleased to offer Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) that are completely configurable by the users. Users in multiple facilities can have access to the data and share it as well!

 

# CRI and New Developments

The field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) is growing in leaps and bounds. As the needs of research facilities are constantly changing, so should the Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) they have implemented. Unfortunately, many LIMS software systems are what they are, and were not developed to be able to add new processes. There are LIMS available that will grow with the lab’s needs therefore; eliminating the need to upgrade the system every time new clinical research theories are developed. The professionals at LIMS ABC know that new theories are being developed consistently and offer a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) that will adapt to the constantly changing world of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI).

# Clinical Research Informatics and Multiple Facilities

More and more clinical research facilities have multiple places where work is performed and samples are tested and stored. Honestly, there’s only so much square footage in a single property. These facilities are also more productive when they have a variety of experienced researchers from several areas. In the past, the idea of numerous facilities was farfetched. With the flexibility that Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) provide, this is becoming a commonplace way of doing business. It’s the way of the future and LIMS ABC is helping clinical research labs step into the forthcoming times.
