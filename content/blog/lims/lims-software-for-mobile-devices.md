It is absolutely essential that laboratories and other facilities that use Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) turn their backs on the systems of the past and move into the twenty-first century. Sure, LIMS technology was good in the past however; the incredible advancement of LIMS technology will soon leave those without newer LIMS in the dust. LIMS technology is meant to help make work in the lab easier and to improve the quality of the data.
