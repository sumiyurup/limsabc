The integrity of a lab facility’s data is of the utmost importance. Think about it! The whole reason there are labs is so that data and samples could be collected, compiled and stored.

For years, this was done manually however; since Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) have become widely used, the resulting data has improved in quality. Fortunately, LIMS have developed over the years and LIMS ABC is a leader in the industry.
