One of the most difficult problems laboratories deal with is effective management of their equipment. This is not meant to imply that people in labs are out there sneaking the lab’s equipment out under their jackets or in their backpacks. It merely means that keeping track of the records on the equipment can be problematic. Very few Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) are capable to manage such data for equipment. The labs that do have equipment managing LIMS have found them to be extremely valuable to their facilities efficiency. Let’s face it! If the equipment is not maintained at the proper times, the value of the data is compromised. LIMS ABC is a leading provider of Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and is one of the few LIMS providers that offer LIMS with equipment management capabilities.

 

# Managing Equipment Maintenance with LIMS

There isn’t a piece of mechanical equipment that has been created that doesn’t require regular maintenance. It’s just a factual thing when working with equipment. For a lab, knowing that the equipment is being maintained properly is essential to their developing qualitative data. It is very beneficial for a lab to be able to manage their equipment’s maintenance records with Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). LIMS ABC is one of the leading LIMS vendors globally and offers LIMS that can manage equipment data.

# LIMS for Managing Equipment Inspection Records

Every lab needs to have their equipment inspected for quality assurance. Keeping track of these inspection records can be overwhelming, especially if the organization has more than one facility. Oftentimes, inspection records for a lab’s equipment must be produced on a regular basis. It would be rather embarrassing for a facility to be unable to locate the needed records. A LIMS software that is able to manage a facility’s equipment inspection reports is extremely helpful. Since LIMS ABC creates custom Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) that are tailor made to every client’s lab, a LIMS with the ability to manage equipment inspection records is available.
