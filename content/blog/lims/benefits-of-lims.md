The biggest and most important asset that is needed in a laboratory is information; however managing that data can prove to be problematic. There are plenty of impressive benefits for those who use LIMS technology, but a lot of labs can't get past the expense. Those in the upper management of laboratories often believe that the way they currently manage their data is sufficient. The truth is that with LIMS, the integrity of the data improves drastically. The quality of the lab's data should always come before the investment cost of Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS).

 

# The Portability of LIMS Software

In the last decade, the explosion of handheld PCs has had a great impact on the ability to find and manage information all over the world. A lot of people are now working from home thanks to the portability of the information they need to do their jobs. This is also true for those working in laboratories. With the right LIMS software, nearly any lab can drastically cut down on their overhead costs by having some of their employees work from home. Although the initial investment costs of a LIMS system can be high, the portability of the data can help reduce the cost for maintaining a large area for employees to work.

# Complete LIMS System Customization

When it comes to investing in Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS), it is essential that there is the ability to customize the system to meet the needs of the individual lab. There aren't any two labs that run in the exact same way; hence the need for customization. A LIMS software that can be customized by the individual user can increase productivity and improve the quality of the data within the laboratory. This greatly increases the functionality of the LIMS system. With some testing and analysis, the LIMS can be exactly what is needed for efficient use in your lab.
