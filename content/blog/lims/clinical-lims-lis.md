Clinical LIMS facilitates the laboratories ability to adjust to different requirements and various workflows rapidly. Clinical LIMS provide an unmatched level of flexibility for labs to run their day-toâ€“day business and workflows. The clinical LIMS is well defined, modified and maintained to match and coordinate the workflows of every laboratory.

The well-equipped design tools are user-configurable and facilitate the product to implement laboratory oriented workflow rules, force operational performance and efficiency improvements. All the data and information are delivered whenever required in the appropriate format and through the correct mechanism i.e. email, fax, report, hard copy etc.

Generally, the clinical LIMS is a completely web-based system. All functionality, administrative features and interfaces run a Graphical User Interface which is based on the browser. This utilizes familiar and standard tools and features; hence trimming down the learning curve for its new users.

 

Clinical LIMS requires zero client-side installation and allows for users quick operation at single or multiple geographic sites. In turn, this activity generates quick return on investment. Various clinical LIMS include some advanced internet tools which include programmable .NET and XML technologies to offer a scalable architecture.

Clinical LIMS are able to support everything from single to multisite, enterprise-wide system. It also maintains predictable system response times and allows continuous expansion and growth.

# What is LIS?

Just like the clinical LIMS, there are various LIS developing companies as well. Laboratory Information System is a type of software that collects, processes and stores information produced through medical laboratory practices. These systems should be in line with instruments and various other information systems.

There are many software programs that offer advanced functionality, a strong database for in-depth analysis, controlling capabilities and quality assurance with some added benefits. The workflows and procedures of every laboratory are different, causing their needs to be different as well.

The companies design software that facilitates laboratories to incorporate the available functions to meet their specific needs. Each laboratory can easily integrate these tools for maximum usage. Some companies have developed LIMS along with advanced feature modules, such as Blood Bank Transfusion Service, Anatomic Pathology System and Medical necessity Modules. These features make LIMS most suitable to integrate into hospital and clinical systems and practice management.

With such well-equipped LIMS, private laboratories and hospitals have now been able to generate higher returns on investment by improving their services and reimbursement rates. The laboratories are also able to make the most of their present IT resources.

# Why clinical laboratories prefer LIMS over LIS?

LIS (Laboratory Information Systems) lack the detailed management functionality of LIS; however it has been satisfactory for various clinical applications. During the past years, many laboratories have preferred LIMS over LIS.

This practice raises an important question related to the difference among the two kinds of systems and also the contribution of a fully loaded LIMS in a clinical set up.

Clinical tests have turned increasingly more complicated, mainly to support growth in analytical and personalized medicine that greatly rely upon PCR technologies and molecular diagnostics. Such intricate testing raises the need for powerful and flexible laboratory workflow tools.
