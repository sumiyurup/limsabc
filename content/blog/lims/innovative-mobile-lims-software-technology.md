When the original Laboratory Information Management Systems came to like in the 1980s, it helped labs and research facilities make incredible advancements. Many of those advancements have paved the way for all of the new technology that everyone enjoys today. Although LIMS software has come a long ways since then, many companies still are dead set on having the users locate and enter data from desktop computers at their work stations. This can be counterproductive, especially when the data is formulated in one place and needs to be entered in another place. LIMS ABC has developed new LIMS software technology that is easily accessed from a user’s iPad or Android tablet.

 

# LIMS Software Technology for iPad and Android Tablet Users

There have been so many employees of laboratory facilities wondering why they have to be at their desks or workstations to locate, access, or enter data into the LIMS system. This is truly a valid point worthy of discussion. In the time that it takes for the worker to leave the testing area and get to the desktop computer, the information could be compromised. It is so much wiser and easier to input the data into the LIMS by way of a mobile device, such as an iPad or Android tablet. Fortunately, LIMS ABC has incredible mobile LIMS software that does allow users to access and log data into the LIMS system using their mobile tablet devices.
