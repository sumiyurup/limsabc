The ability to accurately log samples into a facility and manage their locations is essential to a lab facility’s ability to run fluidly. This can be extremely difficult if the organization is in control of several storage facilities. Tracking the history of the sample and being able to locate testing results are of equal importance. When there is the slightest bit of room for error, the integrity of the samples and data acquired for it is jeopardized. No lab can afford to have a compromise in the quality of their data. A high quality LIMS Software can make all of those potential problems nearly non-existent. LIMS ABC is one of the leading providers of fully functional Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) for lab facilities all over the globe.

Even though it does happen, it is completely unacceptable. Losing a sample throws all of the work and data collected straight out the window. It complete negates everything that was learned and recorded. A top notch LIMS Software with sample tracking capabilities would be extremely beneficial to the facility. LIMS can mean the difference between wasted time and becoming more efficient in tracking the samples. At LIMS ABC, we can create a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) that is form fitted to the needs of your lab facility.

# A LIMS Software for Chain of Custody Quality

Maintaining the information regarding the chain of custody for samples is of the utmost importance in the lab. Chain of custody provides proof that the sample has not been tampered with or compromised in any way. Many Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) cannot handle chain of custody control. Only very few LIMS vendors offer this with their LIMS. Fortunately, LIMS ABC can provide your lab with a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) that will allow users to track the chain of custody of the samples in your facilities.
