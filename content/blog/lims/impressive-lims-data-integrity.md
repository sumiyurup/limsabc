In a lab facility, the integrity of the data is of the utmost importance. Before the early 1980s, labs functioned by using paper, a pen and a slide rule! All tracking of data and samples were kept in monstrous books that were handwritten. Poor handwriting skills were always a problem that could lead to compromised data. All of the necessary reports needed to be manual typed onto papers with carbon paper between sheets to make duplicate or triplicate reports! It’s hard to imagine that the data would be anything close to accurate. Now, Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) have made way for increased integrity of a facility’s data. When an organization cares about the quality of their labs’ data, they acquire a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) from LIMS ABC, a leading provider of LIMS globally.

 

# LIMS for High Quality Data Management

During the mid-1980s, the first Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) was developed. Although quite rudimentary, the first LIMS did make life easier in the lab as well improved the quality of the data. By the late 1990s, Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) no longer used minicomputers and began storing data on PCs. This made lab tracking easier. Fortunately, we’re in the 21st Century now and LIMS software has come a long way! At LIMS ABC, they provide labs with state of the art Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) for improved data quality.

# Improving Data Quality with LIMS Software

Managing the labs data from logging samples into the facility through the reporting process is made easier with a high quality Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). But imagine being able to manage the locations of samples in a multitude of facilities and track when equipment was serviced as well as read the reports regarding equipment inspections. All of this is possible with a high quality Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).
