When you are in the selection stages for purchasing a LIMS system for your laboratory, the investment costs shouldn't be the only factor to consider. It is of the utmost importance that you know about the safety, reliability and security of the Laboratory Information Management Systems that you are considering. These are paramount characteristics that must be taken into consideration. In order for a LIMS to have all of these properties, you will need to spend some time looking at the various LIMS software available on the market today. In the end, you will certainly find that LIMS ABC has everything that you need and expect in a Laboratory Information Management System.

 

# The Two Important Elements

There are two incredibly important elements when it comes to the safety, reliability and security of Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). They are the implementation programming language and the operating system. The programming language simply must have the ability to handle defensive programming. Without this, you could be dead in the water. In order for the programming language to be completely viable, it should be capable of garbage collection, exception handling and variable typing. The operating system should be able to monitor, regulate and ensure that the LIMS system is not accessed by unauthorized users.

# User IDs and Passwords for LIMS Software

Most Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) provide for the typical user IDs and passwords for security. This can be quite fragile. Consideration must be given to the fact that users often forget their own passwords as well as there are "sniffing" techniques that can divulge users' passwords. By ensuring that the users keep their passwords safe and that they change them weekly can help to protect the data. A LIMS software with capabilities for digital signatures can also help to authenticate the user and data for the system. Of course, voice recognition, finger printing or retinal scans would be a bonus for keeping data secure.
