There isn’t a lab in the world that hasn’t had issues managing their samples at one time or another. The ability to immediately log the location of each sample is essential to efficiency however; keeping track of the location manually can be a daunting task. Humans lose track of important things all the time. Think about it! Everyone has lost track of their keys, cell phone or other important item. Human error is to be expected. The chances of human error are lessened with a custom Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). LIMS ABC can create a high quality LIMS that will help to improve your lab’s sample management procedures as well as tracking of those samples.

 

# Managing Samples with LIMS Software

Not every Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is the same. An “out of the box” LIMS will do nothing for your organization other than suck some of the funds out of the accounts. LIMS can be a major investment. Your lab needs to spend its money wisely and invest in a LIMS that is custom created for your company. Without a custom LIMS, the organization is merely throwing its money to the wind. Wasting money on subpar tools is a big mistake in any industry. A Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) from LIMS ABC will never be a mistake. They are a leading company providing LIMS software to labs all over the world.

# Locating Samples Easily with LIMS

Laboratories always need to know exactly in which storage facility particular samples are stored. This is a no brainer as the integrity of the data depends upon the chain of custody. A missing link of that chain of custody will deem the data unusable as well as questionable in the scientific community. Maintaining your lab’s integrity is essential. No one will do business with a lab that has questionable sample tracking procedures. LIMS ABC can provide your lab with a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) that will help the users keep track of all samples and data.

# Investing in a LIMS System

Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) can take your lab into the future. The old school LIMS simply cannot compete with integrated LIMS systems customized to your lab’s needs.
